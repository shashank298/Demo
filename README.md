# Demo
UI task of Smatsuite frontend developer.

# Prerequisites -

1) Node JS >10 
2) Angular CLI – latest

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.7.

## Run the project – 

All the required libraries needs to be installed to run the project as I’ve not shared the node_modules folder.

I have used browser local storage to store the data. If the application is open in two different windows of a browser and if someone submits the form in one window and those submitted details will be shown in the table of the other window.

I tried to store the data in the google sheets, I’m getting the response as success but the data is not getting inserted in the sheet. 

I referred to this blog for posting the data to sheet (https://medium.com/@dmccoy/how-to-submit-an-html-form-to-google-sheets-without-google-forms-b833952cc175)
